## BASIS FOR ASSESSMENT {-}

### Assessment Details {-}

<!-- [Mandatory] -->

Pacific Herring in BC are managed as
`r number_to_word(length(major_regions_short))` major and
`r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))` minor
SARs (Figure XX).
The major SARs are `r commify(major_regions_full_parens)`.
The minor SARs are `r commify(minor_regions_full_parens)`.
We conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the major SARs.
For the minor SARs, we present available
catch data, biological data, and spawn survey data
(Section XX).
Beginning in 2021 we include similar data for the special area, Area 10
(Section XX).
Note that Area 10 is a subset of the CC SAR
and is outside the SAR boundary.
Formal analyses of stock trends are not included for
minor SARs or special areas.

Pacific Herring in the major SARs are assessed using a
spatially integrated statistical catch at age herring (SISCAH)
stock assessment model [@dfo2023a].
SISCAH is fit to
spawn survey indices,
fishery age composition data, and
commercial catches.

Since initiating the Pacific Herring MSE process,
we have included MP evaluations in annual stock assessments:

1. The 2018 stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs [@dfo2019a].

1. The 2019 stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for the HG, PRD, and CC SARs [@dfo2020a], and
implements the previous years' MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs. 

1. The 2020 stock assessment includes
an update to MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs [@dfo2021b], and
implements the previous years' MP recommendations for the HG, PRD, and CC SARs.

1. The 2021 stock assessment includes
an update to MP recommendations for the PRD and CC SARs [@dfo2021c], and
implements the previous years MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs.

1. The 2022 stock assessment includes
an update to MP recommendations for the PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs [@dfo2022b].

1. The 2023 stock assessment includes... [@dfo2024].

1. SISCAH updates... [@dfo2023a]

<!-- TODO: Update -->
This `r assess_yr` stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI,
derived in 2022 by updating herring OM conditioning [@benson2022] using 
the latest historic stock and fishery data
from `r major_start_yr` to 2021 [@dfo2022b].
There are no new MP evaluations for `r assess_yr`
(all probability metrics reflect MP evaluations presented in 2022).

- Limit Reference Point (LRP): $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017],
where $\SB_0$ is estimated unfished spawning biomass.

- Upper Stock Reference (USR): average spawning biomass
from `r yr_range[1]` to `r yr_range[2]` $\overline{\SB}$
(provisional; IFMP).

- Removal Reference (RR): 

- Target (TRP):

### Data {-}

<!-- [Mandatory. -->
<!-- Maximum length 300 words.]  -->

<!-- Data changes: -->
<!-- [Optional (otherwise, do not include).] -->

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and abundance data.
<!-- These data are described in the following sections, and -->
<!-- summarized in Table XX. -->
Relative to the previous assessment,
the only change to input data was to extend all the time series
to include the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).
Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

## BASIS FOR SCIENCE ADVICE {-}
<!-- TODO (JC): check if I changed the title -->

### Assessment Details {-}
<!-- [Mandatory] -->

This report presents science advice for the Pacific Herring Strait of Georgia 
(SoG) stock assessment region, which is one of the 
`r number_to_word(length(major_regions_short))` major stock areas; the other 
major and the `r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))` minor stock
areas are presented in REF(2024SR).

SoG Pacific Herring are assessed with a management 
strategy evaluation (MSE) process, which implements a spatially integrated statistical 
catch at age herring (SISCAH) modelling framework [@dfo2023a]. 
The modelling framework is fitted to historical time series of spawn survey indices, 
biological and fishery age composition data, and commercial fishery catches.

The SISCAH operating model represents SoG Herring historical biomass time series 
from 1951-2003 with these features: density dependent mortality (DDM), an integrated surface 
and dive survey index, commercial fishery timing, and a 
likelihood function with correlated age-compositions.
Density dependent natural mortality was added to represent potential ecosystem 
impacts (e.g., depensatory predation) on Pacific Herring stocks in line with
DFO's EAFM (ecosystem approaches to fisheries management).

A weighted ensemble operating model is used for management procedure 
evaluation, containing five different models 
representing a range of productivity levels. Productivity is characterized
by stock recruitment steepness 
($h$), which affects productivity at low stock sizes, and the lower 
limit on natural mortality ($M_b$), which represents the average mortality rate 
at high stock sizes. This chosen approach represents uncertainty in stock 
productivity better than using a single value of stock-recruit steepness,
which is difficult to estimate and often reliant on prior information.
Details of the operating model ensemble are described in Appendix A.

The weighted ensemble OM was used to simulate management procedures (MPs) over a 
15-year projection period (2024-2038) and present a MP tuned to meet 
the conservation objective (#addhyperlink) and that is

This SISCAH modelling framework [@johnson2024] provides stock status and MPs 
with associated quota calculations for the SoG Herring for the 2024/25 season.

### Stock Structure Assumption {-}
<!--Stock overview information: -->
<!--[reference to a Research Document or other publication, and/or footnote to the working paper] -->
<!--[Mandatory. Maximum length 150 words.]-->

SoG Herring is one of five major Pacific Herring stocks managed in British Columbia. 
The other major and minor stocks are described in [@dfo2024].
The stock spawns in the SoG area sometimes with multiple locations and timing. 
Post spawning, mature SoG Herring
migrate to the west coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) to share share summer/ fall 
feeding grounds with WCVI Herring. However adult herring are also reported in the 
Salish Sea throughout the summer months indicating some level of non-migratory life
history. New genetic methods are currently being used to update baseline data for SoG
spawning areas which may provide more insight on sub-stock structure in the Salish Sea.

### Reference Points {-}
<!-- [Mandatory. -->
<!-- A table may be used in lieu of bullets for this section. -->
<!-- Refer to the Guidance Document for further instructions.] -->
For Pacific Herring MSE we present a suite of biological and fishery reference 
points as performance metrics for the MP evaluations. 
These are derived as fractions of ${B_0}$ (unfished spawning biomass), 
${MSY}$ (maximum sustainable yield), and $U_{MSY}$ (the harvest rate at ${MSY}$).

#### Limit Reference Point (LRP) {-}
In 2018, a biological limit reference point (LRP) was defined for Pacific
Herring major stocks as $0.3B_0$ in 2018, where ${B_0}$ is the long-term
average estimated unfished spawning biomass (@kronlund2017, @forrest2023).
This LRP is more conservative than the default LRP identified in 
“DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework” policy.

#### Upper Stock Reference (USR) {-}
Candidate USRs were first introduced in @cleary2018 and a formal analysis of 
USR options was undertaken in 2022 [@dfo2022a].
Following consultations, DFO Resource Management then selected and implemented 
${0.8B}_{1998:2007}$ as a "provisional USR" for 2022/23 IFMP 
process where the USR was included as a performance metric in the MP evaluations.
Because consultations are ongoing for SoG Herring USRs we include all 
four candidate USRs as performance metrics in this document.

#### Target Reference Point (TRP) {-}
A biomass target objective centered on the USR has been suggested Within the 
Herring MSE process, however selection of a USR for SoG Herring requires 
additional consultations and thus a TRP is not yet definable.

#### Removal Reference (RR) {-}
The default maximum RR for commercially harvested fish stocks is $F_{MSY}$ [@dfo2009, @dfo2013].
All MPs presented for Pacific Herring stocks that are shown in simulation to 
avoid the LRP with high probability, and thus meet the conservation objective, include 
maximum target harvest rates below $U_{MSY}$.
We do not specify an additional RR for SoG Herring because with MSE we use
simulations to select a MP tuned directly to the conservation objective (which 
implements harvest rates more conservative than $U_{MSY}$.

#### Habitat or Ecosystem Reference Points {-}
<!-- TODO (JC): edit and fill in. -->
Ecosystem reference points are incorporated into the Limit Reference Point
both via an LRP above what may be deemed necessary by ____ and by incorporating
density dependant mortality. This is done especially to take into account
that herring are in the middle of the food chain. 


### Fishery management objectives {-}

Our primary objective is a conservation objective supporting
the LRP.[@dfo2019c]

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the LRP with
at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.3 \SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

Three additional proposed objectives are used as performance metrics
for MP evaluation. These are:

2. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% 
probability over three Pacific Herring generations (i.e., achieve a 
target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq \SB_{targ}) \geq 0.50$),

3. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three
Pacific Herring generations (i.e., minimize catch variability; 
$\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

4. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring 
generations (i.e., maximize average catch).

DFO continues to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop 
area-specific objectives for Indigenous fisheries and 
engage with the herring industry, government and non-government 
organizations to describe broader objectives related to conservation, 
economics, and access.

### Operating Model Stock Status {-}

Stock status for the SoG aggregate stock is derived from the operating model 
ensemble which represents weighting across five different models each 
representing a range of productivity levels (details in Appendix A).
<!-- TODO (MG): pls add hyperlink to AppendixA.Rmd)-->

Section X reports the ensemble model stock status for 2023.
<!-- TODO (MG): pls add hyperlink to 03_assessment.Rmd)-->

Operating models for SoG Herring will be updated every three years.
In 2026 the SISCAH model will be fit to new SoG survey and fishery data (extending
the historical time series) and MPs will be re-evaluated against fishery management
objectives. At this time new objectives and performance metrics may
also be added to the MSE process.

In the interim years, operating model status remains constant, only the
a biomass estimate is updated annually and applied to the management 
procedure (next section).

<!-- TODO (SP): anything missing for this section?-->

### Harvest Decision Rule {-}

This MSE report presents sustainable harvest advice for SoG Herring using 
simulation tested MPs in which we identify the maximum target harvest rate for 
a MP tuned to the established conservation objective using a 15-year projection
period. 
We also report simulated performance against a suite of other biological and 
fishery reference points, with details described in Section X.
<!-- TODO (MG): pls add hyperlink to ### Projections in 03_assessment.Rmd)-->

The harvest control rule component of each simulation-test MP is a "hockey-stick" 
shaped function defined by lower and upper control points, and a maximum 
target harvest rate [@cox2013roles]. 
We explored two hockey-stick shapes which differed in their lower and upper
control points, and three 3 maximum target harvest rates (Figure \@ref(fig:hcrPlot)).

Sustainable harvest advice for SoG Herring for 2024/25 is presented using 
a MP tuned to the conservation objective. This MP has lower and upper control 
points at 30\% and 60\% of unfished spawning biomass and a maximum target harvest 
($maxTHR$) of 14\% (green solid line, Figure \@ref(fig:hcrPlot)).

<!-- TODO (JC): get fig:hcrPlot to show in this section-->

### Performance Evaluation for Interim Years and Exceptional Circumstances {-}

For each interim year we do not refit the operating model. Instead a new biomass 
estimate is applied to the MP to calculate the TAC and compared to exceptional
circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are determined by visually comparing 
catch and spawn index estimates for the new year
with the central 95\% of the ensemble operating model simulations.
Any unusual deviations from the ensemble model projections, for example, 
if the realized catch far exceeds TAC prescribed by the MP or if the survey
index is far below the projected index, would be investigated in detail and 
consideration given to refitting operating models.


### Data {-}

<!-- [Mandatory. -->
<!-- Maximum length 300 words.]  -->

<!-- Data changes: -->
<!-- [Optional (otherwise, do not include).] -->

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and a fishery independent survey index.
The fishery survey index is made up of two classes of surveys, surface
and dive. Combining the surveys to give the blended index is a feature 
of the new SISCAH model. Note `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season`
Pacific Herring season.

Incomplete
<!-- TODO (SP): can you pls add 2-4 sentences here (copy from herringsr). Mention blended index as new. 
Also, this section feels awkward to me at the end.  
(eg, after Stock Structure Assumption)?-->

### Assessment Details {-}
<!-- [Mandatory] -->

This report presents science advice for the Pacific Herring Strait of Georgia 
(SoG) stock assessment region, which is one of the 
`r number_to_word(length(major_regions_short))` major stock areas; the other 
major and the `r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))` minor stock
areas are presented in REF(2024SR).

SoG Pacific Herring are assessed with a management 
strategy evaluation (MSE) process, which implements a spatially integrated statistical 
catch at age herring (SISCAH) modelling framework [@dfo2023a]. 
The modelling framework is fitted to historical time series of spawn survey indices, 
biological and fishery age composition data, and commercial fishery catches.

The SISCAH operating model represents SoG Herring historical biomass time series 
from 1951-2003 with these features: density dependent mortality (DDM), integrated surface 
and dive survey data in the index, commercial fishery timing, and a 
likelihood function with correlated age-compositions.
Density dependent natural mortality was added to represent potential ecosystem 
impacts (e.g., depensatory predation) on Pacific Herring stocks and is an 
effective mechanism for advancing DFO's EAFM (ecosystem approaches to fisheries 
management) commitment for SoG Herring.
<!-- TODO (SP): check this last statement --> 

A weighted ensemble operating model is used for management procedure 
evaluation, whereby the ensemble contains five different models each 
representing a range of productivity levels, characterized by stock recruitment steepness 
($h$), which affects productivity at low stock sizes, and the lower 
limit on natural mortality ($M_b$), which represents the average mortality rate 
at high stock sizes. This chosen approach represents uncertainty in stock 
productivity better than using a single value of stock-recruit steepness,
which is difficult to estimate and often reliant on prior information.
Details of the operating model ensemble are described in Appendix A.

The weighted ensemble OM was used to simulate management procedures (MPs) over a 
15-year projection period (2024-2038) and present a MP tuned to meet 
the conservation objective (#addhyperlink) and that is

This SISCAH modelling framework [@johnson2024] provides stock status and MPs 
with associated quota calculations for the SoG Herring for the 2024/25 season.

### Stock Structure Assumption {-}
<!--Stock overview information: -->
<!--[reference to a Research Document or other publication, and/or footnote to the working paper] -->
<!--[Mandatory. Maximum length 150 words.]-->

Stock overview information:
SoG Herring is one of five major Pacific Herring stocks managed in British Columbia. 
The other major and minor stocks are described in [@dfo2024].
Since 1951, annual scientific surveys, data collection and stock assessment focus on the 
core spawn timing associated with the main migratory stock. Post spawning, mature SoG Herring
migrate to the west coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) to share share summer/ fall 
feeding grounds with WCVI Herring.

Additionally, unknown biomass's of adult herring are also reported in various areas of the 
Salish Sea throughout the summer months indicating some level of non-migratory life
history. New genetic methods are currently being used to update baseline data for SoG
spawning areas which may provide more insight on sub-stock structure in the Salish Sea.

### Reference Points {-}
<!-- [Mandatory. -->
<!-- A table may be used in lieu of bullets for this section. -->
<!-- Refer to the Guidance Document for further instructions.] -->
For Pacific Herring MSE we present
a suite of biological and fishery reference points as performance metrics
for the MP evaluations. These are derived as fractions of ${B_0}$ (unfished spawning biomass), 
${MSY}$ (maximum sustainable yield), and $U_{MSY}$ (the harvest rate at ${MSY}$).

#### Limit Reference Point (LRP) {-}
In 2018, a biological limit reference point (LRP) was defined for Pacific
Herring major stocks as $0.3B_0$ in 2018, where ${B_0}$ is the long-term
average estimated unfished spawning biomass [@kronlund2017, @forrest2023].
This LRP is more conservative than the default LRP identified in 
“DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework” policy.

#### Upper Stock Reference (USR) {-}
Candidate USRs were first introduced in @cleary2018 and a formal analysis of 
USR options was undertaken in 2022 [@dfo2022a].
Following consultations, DFO Resource Management then selected and implemented 
$0.8 \overline{\B}_{1998:2007}$ as a "provisional USR" for 2022/23 IFMP 
process where the USR was included as a performance metric in the MP evaluations.
Because consultations are ongoing for SoG Herring USRs we include all 
four candidate USRs as performance metrics in this document.

#### Target Reference Point (TRP) {-}
A biomass target objective centered on the USR has been suggested Within the 
Herring MSE process, however selection of a USR for SoG Herring requires 
additional consultations and thus a TRP is not yet definable.

#### Removal Reference (RR) {-}
The default maximum RR for commercially harvested fish stocks is $F_{MSY}$ [@dfo2009, @dfo2013].
All MPs presented for Pacific Herring stocks that are shown in simulation to 
avoid the LRP with high probability, and thus meet the conservation objective, include 
maximum target harvest rates below $U_{MSY}$.
We do not specify an additional RR for SoG Herring because with MSE we use
simulations to select a MP tuned directly to the conservation objective (which 
implements harvest rates more conservative than $U_{MSY}$.

#### Habitat or Ecosystem Reference Points {-}
<!-- TODO (JC): describe how this is included via DDM parameterization-->


### Fishery management objectives {-}

A core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c]
was introduced to the Pacific Herring MSE process in 2019.
The first of these is a conservation objective, which is centered 
on the LRP.

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the LRP with
at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.3 \SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

<!-- STOPPED HERE -->

2. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% 
probability over three Pacific Herring generations (i.e., achieve a 
target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq \SB_{targ}) \geq 0.50$),

3. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three
Pacific Herring generations (i.e., minimize catch variability; 
$\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

4. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring 
generations (i.e., maximize average catch).


Operating model development began for Herring MSE in 2015, however a fully 
specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each SAR. DFO  
continues to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop area-specific 
objectives for FSC fisheries as well as SOK fisheries (where applicable).
<!-- TODO (JC): check with Bryan about using stronger wording than FSC-->
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with the herring industry and 
government and non-government organizations to describe broader objectives 
related to conservation, economics, and access.

### Operating Model Stock Status {-}

SoG stock status is derived from the operating model ensemble (Appendix A). 
<!-- short description only, no data-->

### Harvest Decision Rule {-}

[Optional (otherwise, do not include).
Maximum length 100 words.]

TACs are derived from biomass estimates via a harvest decision rule. For
SOG herring, we use a "hockey-stick" shaped function defined
by lower and upper control points, and a maximum target harvest rate
[@cox2013roles]. The SOG herring rules have lower and upper control points 
at 30\% and 60\% of unfished biomass, respectively. When biomass 
is estimated to be below the lower control point the rule sets the harvest
rate to zero. Between control points, the harvest rate is a linear ramp 
from zero to the maximum harvest rate, and above the upper control point the 
rule sets harvest rates to the maximum target harvest rate, called $maxTHR$. 
This report shows results for maximum target harvest rates of 6\% 
and 14\% (Figure \@ref(fig:hcrPlot)).


### Data {-}

<!-- [Mandatory. -->
<!-- Maximum length 300 words.]  -->

<!-- Data changes: -->
<!-- [Optional (otherwise, do not include).] -->

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and a fishery independent survey index.
<!-- These data are described in the following sections, and -->
<!-- summarized in Table XX. -->

JC: Finish this. 


Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

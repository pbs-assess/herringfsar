## BASIS FOR ASSESSMENT {-}

### Assessment Details {-}

<!-- [Mandatory] -->

This report presents science advice for the Pacific Herring Strait of Georgia 
(SoG) stock assessment region (SAR), which is one of the 
`r number_to_word(length(major_regions_short))` major and
`r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))` minor SARs; 
the other major and minor SARs are presented in REF(2024SR).

SoG Pacific Herring are assessed using a spatially integrated statistical 
catch at age herring (SISCAH) modelling framework within a management 
strategy evaluation (MSE) process [@dfo2023a], fitted using
spawn survey indices, fishery age composition data, and commercial catches.

For SoG Herring, the SISCAH operating model includes: density dependent
mortality (DDM), integrated surface and dive survey data in the index,
commercial fishery timing, and a likelihood function with correlated 
age-compositions.

A weighted ensemble operating model is used for management procedure 
evaluation, whereby the ensemble contains models that represent a range 
of productivity levels, characterized by stock recruitment steepness 
($h$), which affects productivity at low stock sizes, and the lower 
limit on natural mortality ($M_b$), which herring survival at high
stock sizes. This approach represents uncertainty in stock 
productivity better than using a single value of stock-recruit steepness,
which is difficult to estimate and often reliant on prior information.


Details of the operating model ensemble are described in Appendix A.

Management procedures (MPs) were simulation tested using a 15-year projection 
period (2024-2038); only MPs that meet the established conservation 
objective [@dfo2022a] are presented.

This `r assess_yr` SISCAH modelling framework [@johnson2024] includes stock 
status and MP for SoG Herring.

### Stock Structure Assumption {-}

<!--Stock overview information: -->
<!--[reference to a Research Document or other publication, and/or footnote to the working paper] -->
<!--[Mandatory. Maximum length 150 words.]-->

Stock overview information:
SoG Herring is one of five major stocks managed in British Columbia. 
Data collection and assessment focuses on the core spawn timing associated with 
the main migratory stock. Adult herring are reported in various areas of the 
Salish Sea during the summer months indicating some level of non-migratory life
history, with the largest component of the stock migrating to the west coast to
share summer/ fall feeding grounds with the West Coast Vancouver Island herring.

### Reference Points {-}

A suite of biological and fishery reference points are included for SoG Herring.
These are:
1.    Fractions of unfished biomass, ${SB_0}$
2.    ${MSY}$
3.    Fractions of $U_{MSY}$

In 2018, a biological limit reference point (LRP) was defined for Pacific
Herring major stocks as $0.3SB_0$ in 2018, where ${SB_0}$ is the long-term
average estimated unfished spawning biomass [@kronlund2017].

Candidate USRs were first introduced in @cleary2018 and a formal analysis of 
USR options was undertaken in 2022 with results presented in @dfo2022a.
In 2023, DFO Resource Management selected and implemented a provisional 
USR of $0.8 \overline{\SB}_{1998:2007}$, implemented as a performance metric 
within 2022/23 IFMP process.

### Fishery management objectives {-}

<!-- [If applicable (otherwise, do not include). -->
<!-- A table may be used in lieu of bullets for this section.]  -->

A core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c]
were introduced to the Pacific Herring MSE process in 2019.
The first of these is a conservation objective, which is centered 
on the LRP.

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the LRP with
at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.3 \SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

2. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% 
probability over three Pacific Herring generations (i.e., achieve a 
target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq \SB_{targ}) \geq 0.50$),

3. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three
Pacific Herring generations (i.e., minimize catch variability; 
$\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

4. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring 
generations (i.e., maximize average catch).


Operating model development began for Herring MSE in 2015, however a fully 
specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each SAR. DFO will 
continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop area-specific 
objectives FSC fisheries as well as SOK fisheries (where applicable).
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with the herring industry and 
government and non-government organizations to describe broader objectives 
related to conservation, economics, and access.

### Stock Status {-}

SoG stock status is derived from the operating model ensemble (Appendix A). 
<!-- short description only, no data-->

### Harvest Decision Rule {-}

[Optional (otherwise, do not include).
Maximum length 100 words.]

TACs are derived from biomass estimates via a harvest decision rule. For
SOG herring, we use a "hockey-stick" shaped function defined
by lower and upper control points, and a maximum target harvest rate
[@cox2013roles]. The SOG herring rules have lower and upper control points 
at 30\% and 60\% of unfished biomass, respectively. When biomass 
is estimated to be below the lower control point the rule sets the harvest
rate to zero. Between control points, the harvest rate is a linear ramp 
from zero to the maximum harvest rate, and above the upper control point the 
rule sets harvest rates to the maximum target harvest rate, called $maxTHR$. 
This report shows results for maximum target harvest rates of 6\% 
and 14\% (Figure \@ref(fig:hcrPlot)).


### Data {-}

<!-- [Mandatory. -->
<!-- Maximum length 300 words.]  -->

<!-- Data changes: -->
<!-- [Optional (otherwise, do not include).] -->

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and a fishery independent survey index.
<!-- These data are described in the following sections, and -->
<!-- summarized in Table XX. -->

JC: Finish this. 


Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

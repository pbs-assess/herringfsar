### Status {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
The Strait of Georgia (SoG) major stock assessment region (SAR) is healthy.

Biomass above candidate Upper Stock Reference (USR.)
:::

### Trends {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
Biomass declining from one of the 6th highest peaks since 1950. 

Biomass above candidate USR and established Limit Reference Point (LRP).
:::

### Ecosystem and Climate Change Considerations {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
High LRP = 0.3*(Spawning Biomass)

Time-varying recruitment and density dependant mortality to represent predator, prey, and ecosystem dynamics.

Stocks managed and modelled with regional life-history, and ecosystem pressures.
:::

### Stock Advice {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
Maximum 14\% target harvest rate ($maxTHR$) with hockey stick ramp with lower and upper control 
points at 30\% and 60\% of unfished spawning biomass 
(green solid line, Figure \@ref(fig:plotHCRules)).

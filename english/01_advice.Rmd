### Status {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}

The Strait of Georgia (SoG) major stock assessment region (SAR) is healthy.

Spawning biomass is above the LRP and above all candidate upper stock reference (USRs) points.

:::

### Trends {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}

The ensemble model estimates spawning biomass to be above $B_{MSY}$ and all 5 candidate USRs for most of the historical time series.

Spawning biomass has fluctuated above and below the unfished spawning biomass ($B_0$) for the last 10-years, since increasing from 2010.

### Ecosystem and Climate Change Considerations {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}

The limit reference point (LRP) is set at 0.3${B_0}$ and is implemented using a 
conservation objected which states to “avoid the LRP with a high probability” 
(minimum 75%). This LRP is more conservative than the default LRP identified in 
“DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework” policy (@dfo2009).

Incorporating density dependent mortality and time-varying recruitment 
accounts for predation mortality and ecosystem effects
that Herring experience at their trophic level.

Each major stock area is modelled using regional life-history traits and regional ecosystem pressures.

<!-- TODO: automate this: "ASSESSMENT UNDER MSE" or "Application of MP for 2025" -->
A quota option for 2025 of 11,570 metric tonnes is provided using the management 
procedure with a maximum 14\% target harvest rate applied to the 2025 forecast 
spawning biomass shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plotHCRules).

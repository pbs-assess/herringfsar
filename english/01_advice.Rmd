### Status {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
The Strait of Georgia (SoG) major stock assessment region (SAR) is healthy.

Spawning biomass is above all candidate upper stock reference (USRs) points.
:::

### Trends {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}

The ensemble model estimates spawning biomass to be above $B_{MSY}$ and the 5 candidate USRs for the majority of the historical time series.

Spawning biomass has fluctuated above and below the unfished spawning biomass ($B_0$) for the last 10-years, since increasing from 2010.

:::

### Ecosystem and Climate Change Considerations {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
INCOMPLETE (JC...)

High LRP = 0.3*(Spawning Biomass)

Time-varying recruitment and density dependent mortality to represent predator, prey, and ecosystem dynamics.

Stocks managed and modelled with regional life-history, and ecosystem pressures.
:::

### Stock Advice {-}

::: {custom-style="fsar-bullet"}
INCOMPLETE (JC...)

Maximum 14\% target harvest rate ($maxTHR$) with hockey stick ramp with lower and upper control 
points at 30\% and 60\% of unfished spawning biomass 
(green solid line, Figure \@ref(fig:plotHCRules)).

## BYCATCH {-}

<!-- In order to advance progress towards -->
<!-- a holistic ecosystem-based management (EBM) approach for Pacific Herring, -->
<!-- we present information to describe indirect effects -->
<!-- on Herring populations such as incidental mortality.  -->
Some fisheries and aquaculture activities in BC cause
incidental mortality to Pacific Herring.
Similar to FSC, and recreational catch,
data on incidental mortality is not directly included in the 
assessment process however it is indirectly accounted for in the
annual estimates of natural mortality
and is considered minor relative to commercial harvest.
<!-- Impacts of additional mortality sources will be explored with the new  -->
<!-- modelling framework. -->

<!-- Again this year, we include data for -->
<!-- incidental mortality in finfish aquaculture activities -->

<!-- (Figure XX). -->
<!-- Note that incidental mortality data are reported by -->
<!-- Pacific Fishery Management Area (PFMA) -->
<!-- which are analogous to Statistical Areas, but -->
<!-- PFMAs are larger and can extend beyond SAR boundaries. -->
<!-- Data indicate the number of Pacific Herring dead and released, -->
<!-- with the following caveats: -->

<!-- 1. Unknown mortality rate for "released" fish, -->

<!-- 1. Unknown length, weight, age, and sex of fish, and -->

<!-- 1. "Herring-like" fish are assumed to be Herring -->
<!-- when decomposition hinders identification. -->

<!-- Note that data from previous years are updated  -->
<!-- as DFO receives additional reports. -->

## PROCEDURE FOR INTERIM YEAR UPDATES {-}

Once a harvest control rule is chosen through the MSE 
process, that harvest control rule defines the maximum possible removal rate
given the objective(s) until the next round of MSE occurs.
In the intervening years, an estimate of spawning biomass and  depletion
is obtained using an estimation method (EM) to use with the harvest control rule.
For SoG Herring, the EM used is a spatially integrated statistical catch at age 
Herring (SISCAH) model with density independent $M$ (DIM SISCAH).
This EM was selected because it's performance was similar to the DDM formulation
and it is the less computationally intensive for interim updates.

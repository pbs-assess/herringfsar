## PROCEDURE FOR INTERIM YEAR UPDATES {-}

Once a harvest control rule is chosen through the MSE 
process, that harvest control rule defines the maximum possible removal rate
given the objective(s) until the next MSE cycle.
The recommended MP for the SoG SAR is model-based with a harvest control rule that
depends on annual estimates of projected spawning biomass ($\hat{B}_{Y+1}$) and unfished spawning
biomass ($\hat{B}_0$). These estimates are obtained using an estimation method (EM) and
for SoG Herring, the EM is a spatially integrated statistical catch at age 
Herring (SISCAH) model with density independent $M$ (DIM SISCAH).
This EM was selected because it's performance was similar to the DDM formulation
and it is less computationally intensive for interim updates.

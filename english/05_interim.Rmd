## PROCEDURE FOR INTERIM YEAR UPDATES {-}

Once a harvest control rule is chosen through the management strategy evaluation 
process, that harvest control rule stays in place until the next round of MSE
occurs.
For Pacific Herring in BC that is 3 years or more. 
In the intervening years an estimate of biomass and biomass depletion
is obtained to use with the harvest control rule.
In our case it is the less computationally intensive DIM SISCAH model.

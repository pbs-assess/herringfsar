## SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY {-}
<!--[Mandatory.Maximum length 500 words.] -->
Sources of uncertainty include those surrounding both the data and the model 
estimations. That being said Herring operating models are built on a 
data rich environment and uncertainty is well-accounted for in the model.

<!--TODO (SP): Check if there anything in the "SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY" section 
of the res doc that would be relevant to bring in here -->


### Research Recommendations {-}
<!--[Optional (otherwise, do not include).]-->

The parameters of the ensemble model are currently calculated as a weighted average of the 
five operating models. Future work could involve generating a single weighted posterior 
from the five OMs from which model parameters can be calculated.

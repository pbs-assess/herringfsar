## SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY {-}

Sources of uncertainty include those surrounding
both the data and the model estimations.
That being said, Herring operating models are built on a 
data rich environment and uncertainty is well-accounted for in the model.

### Research Recommendations {-}

The parameters of the SoG ensemble model are currently calculated
as a weighted average of the five operating models.
Future work could involve generating a single weighted posterior 
from the five OMs from which model parameters can be calculated. This
would support a shift to reporting management outputs as median posterior
density values, rather than currently used maximum likelihood estimates.
